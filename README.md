# SQL-Use-Cases
Important SQL use cases and examples

Based on my research I have identified the following main use case categories.
I will continuously implement examples for these use cases and check the sample code into this repository.

As a senior T-SQL developer, you should be proficient in a variety of use cases that demonstrate advanced querying, optimization, and data manipulation skills. Here are some key use cases you should be able to implement:
1.	Complex Joins and Subqueries:
o	Writing queries that involve multiple joins (inner, outer, cross) and subqueries to retrieve data from multiple related tables.
o	Using common table expressions (CTEs) for better readability and maintenance.
2.	Window Functions:
o	Utilizing window functions like ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), and NTILE() for advanced data analysis.
o	Applying LEAD() and LAG() functions to access data from subsequent or preceding rows.
3.	Performance Tuning:
o	Analyzing and optimizing query performance using execution plans.
o	Implementing indexing strategies to improve query performance.
o	Using query hints and optimizing stored procedures.
4.	Stored Procedures and Functions:
o	Creating and maintaining complex stored procedures and user-defined functions (UDFs) for reusable logic.
o	Implementing error handling and transaction management within stored procedures.
5.	Data Transformation and ETL:
o	Designing and implementing ETL processes to extract, transform, and load data from various sources.
o	Using T-SQL for data cleansing, aggregation, and transformation tasks.
6.	Advanced Data Types and XML/JSON Handling:
o	Working with advanced data types like XML and JSON.
o	Writing queries to parse and manipulate XML and JSON data.
7.	Dynamic SQL:
o	Writing dynamic SQL queries to handle flexible and complex query requirements.
o	Ensuring security and performance when using dynamic SQL.
8.	Security and Compliance:
o	Implementing data security measures such as encryption, row-level security, and data masking.
o	Ensuring compliance with industry standards and regulations.
9.	Concurrency and Locking:
o	Managing concurrency issues and understanding locking mechanisms.
o	Implementing isolation levels and handling deadlocks.
10.	Data Warehousing and OLAP:
o	Designing and querying data warehouses.
o	Using T-SQL for OLAP operations and working with cubes.
11. Unit Testing
o	Borowwing ideas from tSQLt and implementing it in a way so that it can be run as TSQL in AzureDB
